While there are other packages which make creating quick - and interactive - plots easier (like [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/), or [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org/)), if you want to create a perfectly styled plot for a publication, matplotlib is usually the best choice.

In the matplotlib documentation (and all over the internet), you will find both of them, sometimes even mixed. We encourage you to use the latter, as it is more explicit and avoids strange bugs.
